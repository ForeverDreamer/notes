# 132. Use Cases - Sets
Redis Sets can be used in a lot of scenarios like;

Unique user tracking visiting a website

Holding unique list of items like user groups, user avtar names, categories, products names, country codes etc.

Sharded data of unique values for an application

IP Tracking - Storing unique IP addresses to track visitors

Implementing a product recommendation based on a user action, similar to Amazon feature where they display 'People also buy these items'

Analyzing Ecommerce Sales - Many online e-commerce websites use Redis Sets to analyze customer behavior, such as searches or purchases for a specific product category or subcategory. For example, an online bookstore owner can find out how many customers purchased technology books in Technology section.

Inappropriate Content Filtering - For any app that collects user input, it’s a good idea to implement some kind of content filtering for any inappropriate words, and we can do this with Redis Sets by adding words you’d like to filter to a SET key and the SADD command. e.g.

SADD bad_words "word1" "word2"


# 133. Quick Reference - Sets
Redis Sets are unordered collections of strings.

They cannot have duplicate values

Sets are good for expressing relations between objects

SADD, SMOVE, SREM, SPOP

Add one or more members, Move a member from one set to another, Remove one or more members, Remove and return one or multiple random members

SCARD, SMEMBERS, SISMEMBER, SRANDMEMBER

Get number of members, Get all members, Test if member exists, Get one or more random members

SUNION, SUNIONSTORE

Get all keys from all sets, no duplicates, same operation but store results in a new key

SINTER, SINTERSTORE

Get keys that exist in all sets only, same operation but store results in a new key

SDIFF, SDIFFSTORE

Return keys from the first set that are not in the subsequent sets, same operation but store results in a new key
