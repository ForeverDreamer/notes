# 145. Use Cases - Sorted Sets
You can call sorted sets a superset version of sets as it carries all the features of sets, only that sets have no order while sorted sets associate every member with a numeric score.

Multiplayer Gaming: On an online gaming applications which required to update multiple games scores list and frequently load top score performers.

Questions and Answers / Community forums: Redis.io website uses Sorted Sets to handle to rank the highest voted answers for each question. In addition stack overflow uses a similar setup for their Q&A setups.


# 146. Quick Reference - Sorted Sets
Sorted sets are a data type which is similar to a mix between a Set and a Hash

Sorted sets are implemented via a dual-ported data structure containing both a skip list and a hash table

Adding elements and retrieving sorted elements is extremely fast.

Like Hashes, sorted sets store multiple fields called members, and their numerical values called scores

All the members are always unique

They are ordered based on their scores

ZADD, ZINCRBY

Add one or more members or update score, Increment the score of a member, Remove one or more members

ZCARD, ZCOUNT, ZSCORE, ZRANK

Get number of members, Count members within sort key (score) range, Get the score associated with the given member, Determine the index of a member

ZRANGE, ZRANGEBYLEX, ZRANGEBYSCORE, ZLEXCOUNT

Get members sorted by sort key (score), Return a range of members by lexicographical range, Return a range of members by score, Count the number of members between a given lexicographical range

ZREM, ZREMRANGEBYLEX, ZREMRANGEBYRANK, ZREMRANGEBYSCORE

Remove one or more members, Remove all members between the given lexicographical range, Remove all members within the given indexes, Remove all members within the given scores

ZREVRANGE, ZREVRANGEBYSCORE, ZREVRANK, ZREVRANGEBYLEX

Return a range of members by index with scores ordered from high to low, Return a range of members by score, with scores ordered from high to low, Determine the index of a member with scores ordered from high to low, Return a range of members by lexicographical range, ordered from higher to lower strings

ZINTERSTORE, ZUNIONSTORE

Get keys that exist in all sets only and store the resulting sorted set in a new key, Add multiple sorted sets and store the resulting sorted set in a new key
